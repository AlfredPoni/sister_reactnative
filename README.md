Sister: A dilation assistant for GCS post-op trans people

This project is in development. The final product will be an application for iOS and Android, written in React Native, that will help trans people who have undergone Gender Confirmation Surgery (vaginoplasty) in their daily dilation.

Name still in the works. Sister is too gender-specific ;)
